# Rajola

#### A nifty Slick2D Tiling Pipeline with camera assistance

This is a **work in progress**, **open source**, class library for Slick2D the Java game engine that helps you in creating 2d games and using OpenGL.

## Introduction

The goal of **Rajola** is to provide Java game developers with a standardized way to implement a tile map in their games without the requirement for any external tools.

## What's included

Here are few functionalities that are (or will) be included:

-    **TileMap :** the glue between all the parts, contains the tiles; includes map layers
-    **TileLevel :** an alternative to the _TileMap_ which allows map creation through a pixel image
-    **TileMapCamera :** will handle map scrolling and smooth scrolling/centering
-    **Tile :** the smallest unit
-    **Sprite :** represents _Tile_ image, can be animated
-    **TileSpriteSheet :** a sprite sheet from wich images can be used in a _TileMap_ layer
